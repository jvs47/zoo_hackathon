# ZooHackathon Vietnam 2021

Regional Problem Statement #1

---

## AWARENESS AND BEHAVIOR CHANGE

Context: Despite the efforts of the government and conservation organizations to protect wildlife and heavier penalties for wildlife trade crimes in legislation, many wildlife species are still being advertised and openly sold at tourist attractions, in local wet markets, and “specialty” restaurants. 
A multi-year study by WCS published in 2020 found six known coronaviruses in wild rats, a common food source in Vietnam, and the risks increase as they move along the trade route, from 32% in wildlife markets to 55% as the rats reach restaurants. Despite the fact that the origins of the current pandemic are thought to lie in wildlife trade, and despite the many warnings by scientists, that wildlife trade chains can be an incubator for a next pandemic, specialty bushmeat and wild birds restaurants were still booming in many provinces even during the pandemic.

## Motivation

By reading all the challenges in ZooHackathon 2021, we agreed ourselves on working into the first regional problem, which is to create an app that fulfills its educational purposes on wildlife. We came up with an app that has news and quiz features that concerns environmental issues. We choose quiz because we think it is the most widely use of information to challenge people's intellectual curiosity and an effective way to memorize. The news feature comes from the fact that we want people to be aware of the current environmental situations all around the world without having to actually search for it. It is a difficulty for those people that are not actively involved in conservation scheme to know the keywords and how to search for informations regarding environmental concerns so we want to create a news feature and a search feature that suggests environmental keywords.

All the codes are written from the second day of Zoohackathon 2021.
